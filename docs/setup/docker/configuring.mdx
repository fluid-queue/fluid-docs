# Configuring the Bot

Now it's time to configure the bot itself, by setting up your `settings.yml`. First, download the [sample settings file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluid-queue/fluid-queue/develop/settings/settings.example.yml) from git and save it as `settings.yml` in your settings folder (next to your `tokens.json`).

## settings.yml

`settings.yml` is where most of the customization of the bot occurs. There's a lot of customization to do, and most of the options are safe to leave as the defaults, but there are a few to make sure you update, marked with **[!]** to make it easier to notice! Open your `settings.yml` in a text editor and customize it as necessary, making sure to update all the marked items.
