# Token setup

<Tokens />

## Setting up `tokens.json`

Open `settings/tokens.json` in your text editor. Replace `{INITIAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}` (including the braces) with the User Access Token, and `{INITIAL_REFRESH_TOKEN}` with the Refresh Token.

:::tip
Do not include the braces; your tokens should be enclosed in quotation marks but not braces.
