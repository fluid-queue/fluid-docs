# Token setup

<Tokens />

## Creating `tokens.json`

Download the [sample tokens.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluid-queue/fluid-queue/main/settings/tokens.example.json) file from our Git repository, and save it in your `settings` folder as `tokens.json`. Replace `{INITIAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}` (including the braces) with the User Access Token, and `{INITIAL_REFRESH_TOKEN}` with the Refresh Token.

:::tip
Do not include the braces; your tokens should be enclosed in quotation marks but not braces.
